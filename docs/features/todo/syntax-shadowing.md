# Syntax Shadowing Rework (Index)

## Overview

Rework "syntax shadowing" (hiding markdown markers) to keep the editor readable while improving editing experience and reducing layout jumps.

This feature is milestone-based and split into dedicated docs:

- **Milestone 1 (Variant A1)**: ✅ [Keep semantic styling while editing](../done/syntax-shadowing-m1-keep-styling-while-editing.md) - **DONE**
- **Milestone 2 (Variant B)**: ✅ [3-state model (Rendered / Ghost / Raw)](../done/syntax-shadowing-m2-three-state-model.md) - **DONE**

Deep-dive background and design variants live in [docs/plans/syntax-shadowing-rework-analysis.plan.md](../../plans/syntax-shadowing-rework-analysis.plan.md).
