To check the feature files for issues, run:

```bash
npm run lint:docs
```
Keep Gherkin tests short and simple. E.g. "Given When Then When Then.."

Before adding or updating a feature file here, check if the main feature list in `README.md` needs to be updated as well. Make sure features, status, and links stay consistent between this folder and the summary tables in the README.
