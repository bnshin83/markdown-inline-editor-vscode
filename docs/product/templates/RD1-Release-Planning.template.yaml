# Release Definition
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define release scope, version, and key information. Generate UUID for the release definition.

# Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Prioritize features using MoSCoW method. Generate UUID for each prioritized feature.

  # MoSCoW Definitions:
  #   - Must Have: Critical features without which the release is not viable
  #   - Should Have: Important features that should be included if possible
  #   - Could Have: Nice-to-have features that can be deferred if needed
  #   - Won't Have: Features explicitly excluded from this release
