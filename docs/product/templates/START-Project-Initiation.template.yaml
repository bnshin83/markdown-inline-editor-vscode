# Project Initiation Template
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Create a high-level project charter that establishes the foundation for the project.

# Project Charter
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Include project vision, objectives, and key stakeholders. Generate UUID for the charter.
project_charter:
  uuid: START-CHR-001  # TYPE: uuid, REQUIRED, FORMAT: {ARTIFACT_UUID}-CHR-{SEQUENCE}
  project_name: ""  # TYPE: string, REQUIRED, MAX_LENGTH: 100
  # EXAMPLE: Markdown Inline Editor VS Code Extension
  project_vision: ""  # TYPE: string, REQUIRED, MAX_LENGTH: 300
  # EXAMPLE: Enable seamless, distraction-free Markdown editing in VS Code
  objectives: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 5
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, objective: string}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: START-OBJ-001
  #     objective: "Objective description"

  expected_duration: ""  # TYPE: string, OPTIONAL, MAX_LENGTH: 50
  # EXAMPLE: 3 months, 6 sprints

# Initial Stakeholder Identification
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Identify key stakeholders at a high level. This will be expanded in ST1. Generate UUID for each stakeholder.
initial_stakeholders: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 10
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, name: string, role: string, interest: enum[High|Medium|Low]}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: START-SHK-001
  #     name: "Stakeholder name"
  #     role: "Role description"
  #     interest: High  # High | Medium | Low

# High-Level Scope Boundaries
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define high-level scope boundaries. This will be refined in PO1. Generate UUID for scope boundaries.
scope_boundaries:
  in_scope: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 8
    # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, item: string}
    # EXAMPLE:
    #   - uuid: START-SCOPE-001
    #     item: "Scope item description"
  out_of_scope: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 1, MAX_ITEMS: 5
    # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, item: string}
    # EXAMPLE:
    #   - uuid: START-OOS-001
    #     item: "Out of scope item"

# High-Level Success Criteria
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define high-level success criteria. These will be refined into measurable KPIs in BN1. Generate UUID for each success criterion.
success_criteria: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 6
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, criterion: string, priority: enum[Critical|High|Medium|Low]}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: START-SUC-001
  #     criterion: "Success criterion description"
  #     priority: Critical  # Critical | High | Medium | Low

# Assumptions and Constraints
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Document key assumptions and constraints. Generate UUID for each.
assumptions: []  # TYPE: array[object], OPTIONAL, MIN_ITEMS: 0, MAX_ITEMS: 5
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, assumption: string}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: START-ASM-001
  #     assumption: "Assumption description"
constraints: []  # TYPE: array[object], OPTIONAL, MIN_ITEMS: 0, MAX_ITEMS: 5
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, constraint: string, type: enum[Technical|Business|Regulatory|Resource]}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: START-CON-001
  #     constraint: "Constraint description"
  #     type: Technical  # Technical | Business | Regulatory | Resource
