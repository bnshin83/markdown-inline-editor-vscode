# Risk Register
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Identify and document all project risks. Generate UUID for each risk. Classify by probability and impact.
risk_register: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 3, MAX_ITEMS: 30
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, risk: string, category: string, probability: enum[High|Medium|Low], impact: enum[High|Medium|Low], risk_score: string, description: string}
  # Risk Score Calculation: Probability × Impact (High=3, Medium=2, Low=1)
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: PM2-RISK-001
  #     risk: "Risk name"
  #     category: "Category name"
  #     probability: "High"  # High | Medium | Low
  #     impact: "High"  # High | Medium | Low
  #     risk_score: "High"  # calculated or explicit
  #     description: "Risk description"

# Risk Response Planning
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define response strategies for each identified risk. Generate UUID for each response plan.
risk_response_planning: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 3, MAX_ITEMS: 30
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, risk_uuid: string (references PM2-RISK-XXX), response_strategy: enum[Avoid|Mitigate|Transfer|Accept], response_plan: string, owner: string, status: enum[Open|In Progress|Closed]}
  # Response Strategy Definitions:
  #   - Avoid: Eliminate the risk by changing the approach
  #   - Mitigate: Reduce probability or impact of the risk
  #   - Transfer: Shift risk to another party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)
  #   - Accept: Acknowledge the risk and proceed (for low-impact risks)
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: PM2-RESP-001
  #     risk_uuid: "PM2-RISK-001"
  #     response_strategy: "Mitigate"  # Avoid | Mitigate | Transfer | Accept
  #     response_plan: "Response plan description"
  #     owner: "Owner name"
  #     status: "Open"  # Open | In Progress | Closed

# Mitigation Strategies
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define detailed mitigation strategies for risks that are being mitigated. Generate UUID for each mitigation strategy.
mitigation_strategies: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 20
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, risk_uuid: string (references PM2-RISK-XXX), mitigation_action: string, timeline: string, resources: string, success_criteria: string}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: PM2-MIT-001
  #     risk_uuid: "PM2-RISK-001"
  #     mitigation_action: "Mitigation action description"
  #     timeline: "Timeline description"
  #     resources: "Resources required"
  #     success_criteria: "Success criteria"
