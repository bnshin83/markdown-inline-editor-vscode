**Status in Our Extension:** ✅ Partially supported (basic checkboxes work)

**Enhancements Needed:**
- Support task lists in ordered lists (`1. [ ] task`)
- Support task lists with asterisk/plus (`* [ ] task`, `+ [ ] task`)
- Handle edge cases (missing spaces, invalid syntax)
- Auto-formatting for checkbox state changes

**Priority:** **High** (GFM standard feature)

#### C. Strikethrough
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Fully supported  
**Status in Our Extension:** ✅ Supported

**Status:** Already implemented, no changes needed.

#### D. Autolinks
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Fully supported  
**Status in Our Extension:** ⚠️ Needs verification

**Requirements:**
- Automatic link detection for URLs (`<https://example.com>`)

- WWW autolinks (`www.example.com` - less common in GFM)

**Priority:** **Medium** (GFM standard feature)

#### E. Emoji Support
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Supported  
**Status in Our Extension:** ❌ Not supported

**Requirements:**
- Emoji shortcodes (`:smile:`, `:+1:`, `:tada:`)
- Render emoji inline (or show shortcode styled)
- Handle invalid emoji shortcodes gracefully

**Priority:** **Medium** (nice-to-have GFM feature)

#### F. Mentions and References
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Supported  
**Status in Our Extension:** ❌ Not supported

**Requirements:**
- GitHub-style mentions (`@username`)
- Issue references (`#123`)
- Styling for mentions/references (distinct from regular text)

**Priority:** **Low** (GitHub-specific, not core GFM)

---

### 2. Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

#### A. Mermaid Diagram Support
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Rendered inline (with webview)  
**Status in Our Extension:** 🚧 Planned (hover preview approach)

**Our Approach (Different from Markless):**
- **Hover preview** instead of inline rendering
- Show rendered diagram on hover over code block
- Simpler implementation (no webview overhead)
- Better performance (no rendering on every change)

**Implementation:**
- Detect Mermaid code blocks (```mermaid)
- Use hover provider to show rendered diagram
- Consider using `@mermaid-js/mermaid` for rendering
- Or use `mermaid.live` API (online service)

**Priority:** **Medium** (advanced feature, not core GFM)

**Why Hover Instead of Inline:**
- Markless's inline rendering has known bugs (issue #10)
- Webview overhead causes performance issues
- Hover preview is simpler and more reliable
- Better user experience (on-demand viewing)

#### B. LaTeX/Math Support
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Rendered inline (with KaTeX)  
**Status in Our Extension:** 🚧 Planned (hover preview approach)

**Our Approach (Different from Markless):**
- **Hover preview** instead of inline rendering
- Show rendered math on hover over math syntax
- Simpler implementation (no KaTeX bundling)
- Better performance (no rendering on every change)

**Implementation:**
- Detect inline math (`$...$`) and block math (`$$...$$`)
- Use hover provider to show rendered math
- Consider using `katex` for rendering
- Or use MathJax (larger but more features)

**Priority:** **Medium** (advanced feature, not core GFM)

**Why Hover Instead of Inline:**
- Markless's inline rendering has bugs (issue #22: fails on files >500 lines)
- Performance issues with multiple math formulas
- Hover preview is simpler and more reliable
- Better user experience (on-demand viewing)

#### C. Image Rendering
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Rendered inline  
**Status in Our Extension:** ✅ Styled (not rendered, by design)

**Our Approach (Different from Markless):**
- **No inline image rendering** (by design)
- Images are styled but not loaded into editor
- Focus on text editing, not image viewing
- Simpler implementation (no image loading)

**Rationale:**
- Markless's image rendering has bugs (issue #12: "Image preview is not working")
- Path resolution is complex and error-prone
- Performance overhead for loading images
- Our focus is on text editing, not image viewing
- Users can use preview pane for images

**Priority:** **Low** (by design, not implementing)

---

### 3. Syntax Enhancements (High Priority)

#### A. Ordered List Auto-Numbering
**Status in Markless:** ✅ Supported  
**Status in Our Extension:** 🚧 Planned

- Handle nested ordered lists
- Support GFM parentheses (`1)`, `2)`)
- Handle out-of-order numbering gracefully

**Implementation:**
- Parse list items and calculate correct numbers
- Hide original markers
- Show calculated numbers as decorations
- Handle edge cases (missing numbers, wrong order)

**Priority:** **High** (improves UX significantly)

#### B. YAML Frontmatter Support
**Status in Markless:** ⚠️ Requested (issue #16)  
**Status in Our Extension:** ❌ Not supported

**Requirements:**
- Detect YAML frontmatter at document start
- Style frontmatter block (background color, distinct appearance)
- Hide frontmatter delimiters (`---`)
- Support frontmatter editing (reveal on selection)

**Priority:** **Medium** (common in Markdown files)

#### C. Highlighting Support
**Status in Markless:** ⚠️ Requested (issue #15)  
**Status in Our Extension:** ❌ Not supported

**Requirements:**
- Support `==text==` highlighting syntax (non-standard GFM)
- Style highlighted text with background color
- Hide highlighting markers

**Priority:** **Low** (non-standard, nice-to-have)

- Parser initialized with GFM plugin
- Need to handle additional GFM node types

**Required Node Types:**
- `table` - Tables
- `tableRow` - Table rows
- `tableCell` - Table cells
- `delete` - Strikethrough (already handled)
- `taskList` - Task lists (partially handled)
- `autolink` - Autolinks
- `html` - HTML in Markdown (for emoji, mentions)

**Parser Enhancements Needed:**
```typescript
// Add to DecorationType
| 'table'
| 'tableRow'
| 'tableCell'
| 'autolink'
| 'emoji'
| 'mention'

// Add to parser.ts
- Handle table nodes
- Handle autolink nodes
- Handle emoji nodes
- Handle mention nodes
```

### Table Implementation

**Approach:**
1. Parse table nodes from AST
2. Calculate cell positions
3. Hide table borders (`|`)
4. Style cell content
5. Handle alignment markers (`:---`, `:---:`, `---:`)

**Challenges:**
- Multi-line cells (with `<br>`)
- Escaped pipes (`\|`)
- Empty cells
- Nested formatting in cells

**Solution:**
- Use `remark-gfm` table parsing (handles edge cases)
- Traverse table AST nodes
- Create decorations for each cell
- Handle nested nodes within cells

### Auto-Numbering Implementation

**Approach:**
1. Parse list items
2. Calculate correct numbers based on position
3. Hide original markers
4. Show calculated numbers as decorations

**Challenges:**
- Nested lists (need to track nesting level)
- Out-of-order numbering (handle gracefully)
- GFM parentheses (`1)` vs `1.`)

**Solution:**
- Track list nesting in parser state
- Calculate numbers based on position in list
- Support both `.` and `)` markers
- Handle edge cases (missing numbers, wrong order)
