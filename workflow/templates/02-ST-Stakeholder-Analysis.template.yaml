# Stakeholder Identification Matrix
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Identify all key stakeholders. Generate UUID for each stakeholder.
stakeholders: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 3, MAX_ITEMS: 20
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, name: string, role: string, organization: string}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: ST1-SHK-001
  #     name: "Stakeholder name"
  #     role: "Role description"
  #     organization: "Organization name"  # optional

# Power/Interest Classification
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Classify each stakeholder by power and interest level. Map to engagement strategy.
power_interest_classification: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 3, MAX_ITEMS: 20
  # SCHEMA: {stakeholder_uuid: string (references ST1-SHK-XXX), power: enum[High|Medium|Low], interest: enum[High|Medium|Low], engagement: enum[Manage Closely|Keep Satisfied|Keep Informed|Monitor]}
  # Engagement Strategy Mapping:
  #   - Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest): Engage frequently, involve in decisions
  #   - Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest): Keep informed, minimal engagement
  #   - Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest): Regular updates, seek feedback
  #   - Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest): Minimal engagement, periodic check-ins
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - stakeholder_uuid: ST1-SHK-001
  #     power: High  # High | Medium | Low
  #     interest: High  # High | Medium | Low
  #     engagement: "Manage Closely"  # Manage Closely | Keep Satisfied | Keep Informed | Monitor

# User Personas
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define key user personas with goals, pain points, and behaviors. Generate UUID for each persona.
user_personas: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 8
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, name: string, role: string, goals: array[string], pain_points: array[string]}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: ST1-PER-001
  #     name: "Persona name"
  #     role: "Role description"
  #     goals:
  #       - "Goal 1"
  #       - "Goal 2"
  #     pain_points:
  #       - "Pain point 1"
  #       - "Pain point 2"

# RBAC Role Map
# AI_INSTRUCTION: Define role-based access control roles with permissions. Generate UUID for each role.
rbac_roles: []  # TYPE: array[object], REQUIRED, MIN_ITEMS: 2, MAX_ITEMS: 10
  # SCHEMA: {uuid: string, role: string, permissions: array[string]}
  # EXAMPLE:
  #   - uuid: ST1-RBAC-001
  #     role: "Role name"
  #     permissions:
  #       - "Permission 1"
  #       - "Permission 2"
